# Extra-Trees Regressor Model for Predicting the Magnetic Moments of Transition Metal Borides

The goal of this project was the development of an extra-trees regressor (ETR) model trained to predict the magnetic moments per formula unit of intermetallic compounds as part of Johan's doctoral thesis. An XGBoost, SNN, and FNN models were also developed by our collaborator Andrew Krikorian available [here](https://github.com/andykr1k/ChemML).
